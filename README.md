## The game

Deadly Science takes place in a maze, the goal is obviously to survive.

For this, you have first of all to take a serum to become a healed player.

There are always one player who remains infected, he has a last chance to win by infecting all other players by the end of a short time. So healed players will have to run for their lives...
